                <ol type="I">
                    <li>
                        Cook the fettucine pasta according to the package instructions
                        until al dente. Drain and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the pasta is cooking, season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
                        In a large skillet, heat the olive oil oover medium heat. Add the chicken breasts
                        and cook for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until cooked through and no longer 
                        pink in the center. Remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest for a few 
                        minutes. Slice the cchicken into thin strips.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the same skillet add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, until fragrant.
                        Be careful not to burn it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce the heat to low and add the heavy cream to the skillet. Stir well to combine 
                        with the garlic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the butter to the skillet and still until melted and fully incorporated into the cream.
                        Gradually whisk in the grated parmesan cheese until the sauce is smooth and

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add
                        a little more cream or pasta cooking water to thin it out.
                    </li>
