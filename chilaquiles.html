                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <hr/>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat your oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C). Spread the tortilla wedges or squares
                        on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until they are
                        crispy and lightly golden. Remove from the oven and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the Salsa
                        and cook for about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Optional: If you prefer a saucier version, add the chicken broth to the skillet and
                        stir well to combine with the salsa. Season with salt to taste.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the baked tortilla chips to the skillet and toss gently to coat them evenly with 
                        the salsa mixture. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the chips to soften slightly in the sauce.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If using, add the cooked shredded chicken or beef to the skillet and stir to incorporate it into the chilaquiles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove the skillet from heat and sprinkle the crumbled queso fresco or shredded Monterey Jack cheese
                        over the chilaquiles. The residual heat will melt the cheese.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve the chilaquiles hot with optional toppings such as diced avocado, sliced jalapenos, and sour cream on the side.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
