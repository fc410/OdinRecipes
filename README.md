# OdinRecipies
For this project I will be creating a recipe website that will contain a few recipes for different foods. This is a project on behalf of The Odin Project and will come back to this later to style with CSS.

## Journey
This project was actually pretty fun and interesting as I was using only HTML and no CSS. I come from a computer science background and have a degree in Computer Science and didn't realize how essential CSS is and how much I constantly think about CSS when creating a webpage. This however, helped me think about the design a lot more and what components I will be using before actually coding. The one thing I did not like at all was how the website looked without any CSS it looks so bland and empty with all the empty white space and can not wait to come back to this project and add css to style it to my liking.
