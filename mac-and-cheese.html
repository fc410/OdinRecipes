            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cook the elbow macaroni according to the package Instructions
                    until al dente. Drain and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the 
                    flour and whisk continuously for about 1-2 minutes to make a roux.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to ensure no
                    lumps form. Continue cooking and whisking until the mixture thickens,
                    for about 3-4 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduce heat to low and add the shredded cheddar cheese and mozzarella
                    cheese to the saucepan. Stir until the cheese has melted and the sauce 
                    is smooth
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season the cheese sause with salt, black pepper, and paprika(if using),
                    and stir well to combine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until the passta is 
                    evenly coated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optional: preheat your oven to 350&deg; F (175&deg;C). Transfer the mac mac-and-cheese
                    mixture to a greased baking dish. Sprinkle grated parmesan cheese on top for an extra cheesy crust
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley,
                    if desired.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve the mac and cheese while it's still hot and creamy. It makes a great comfort food dish
                    on its own or can be paired with a side salad or steamed vegetables. Enjoy!
